During the last years, networks and graphs have been used in a variety of scientific fields, reaching out into solutions about complex scientific issues in computer science, biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, social sciences, economics, and other fields. Specifically, in the fields of economics and data science, metric calculations on large scaled and complex networks have been used more and more lately. In addition, dealing with big data and its continuous growth, graphs and networks are stored in the secondary memory and consequently it has been really hard for the calculations to be done in main memory. The main goal of the following research is to calculate graph metrics (such as average degree, density, diameter, average clustering coefficient, centrality measures, and others) on networks which are stored in modern relational database systems and study their results and applications in economics.
